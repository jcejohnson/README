# README

Projects in the tragus organization are are things I have forked from others.

Projects in the jcejohnson organization are mostly things authored by me.

At any point in time, there may be one or two things at jcejohnson that should be
moved to tragus but the reverse should never be true. That is, *everything* at
tragus is somebody else's work whereas *most* things at jcejohnson were originated
by me.
